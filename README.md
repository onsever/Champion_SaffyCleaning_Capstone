**Future Scope Bug Fixes**
* User and worker profile photo is not updating real-time.
* Sometimes clicking on the adding photo icon in the ChatViewController crashes the application.
* Reviews are not loading real-time. (Rebuilding the application fixes but needs to be solved)
* Fetching address photos from Firebase is working slowly, needs to be optimized.
